# launchpad-shruti-practice

Using a Novation Launchpad Pro to practice the 22 shrutis of Indian classical music.

## Who Might Use This

### Students

* Ear training - what do the different shrutis sound like? Am I able to notice a difference today? With practice, is my ear improving?
* Exploration - what does a raga sound like with its correct shrutis? What makes it correct? What does it sound like if I use the other shrutis? Can I tell the difference at very soft volumes?
* Vocal training - sing first and verify intonation after by using the Launchpad. What are my tendencies? Am I sharp or flat today?
* Transcription - try out different grace notes (kan swaras). Which ones sound like the song?

### Teachers

* Visualize - music learning can be both auditory as well as visual!  How large are the intervals? Which groups of notes (angs) are the same between ragas? What patterns do they make?
* Explain - compare and contrast the shrutis used by different ragas. What is common to ragas the student has previously studied? What makes this one unique? What gives it its character (bhava)?
* Reveal - underlying harmonic relationships among shrutis. Which notes are related by perfect fifths and major thirds?
* Inuit - tonal centers in ragas (vadi/samvadi swaras). Which notes anchor the others?

### Creators

* Swar mandal - the Launchpad makes a nice, well-tuned swar mandal!
* Extend - apply the same tuning to any MIDI instrument of your choice



## Audio Demos in Ragas

Hearing is believing! Quick 15 second demos of various ragas encompassing 16 of the 22 shrutis.

Each demo features the arohi (ascending scale) and avarohi (descending scale), and concludes with a faster swar mandal-like descending flourish that really brings out the combined, blending consonance aka mood (bhava) of the raga.

Particularly interesting notes to listen for are indicated in bold.

The demos are saved inside the `docs/` folder, but for GitHub.com and mobile convenience here is a Soundcloud playlist as well.

## Prerequisites

* Launchpad Pro
  - Only Pro supports Programmer aka custom MIDI mode and RGB colors
* Mac OS X
  - Tested on 10.14 Mojave
  - [Midimap](https://github.com/voidqk/midimap) for Mac (prebundled)
* Native Instruments
  - Kontakt Player
    - Free player is OK to use the already exported pratice sets `.nki` files. Otherwise the paid version is required to access the script editor (see below)
  - Kontakt Factory Library
    - Used for the playable Tanpura
    - Specifically just the `World/6 - Strings/Tanpura.nki` sample
  - [India Discovery Series](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/world/india/) (optional)
    - For the background tanpura, very rich sound

See [Native Instruments Komplete Version Comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C2lEubeNV6OzUnj5o8o6pBPU_jGgzeCALNTLOnoPxeA/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=113346694824160986526) for an awesome spreadsheet to help identify which Komplete bundles contain these libraries.

## How to Use

1. Connect the Launchpad Pro via USB and enter Programmer Mode. See the [Launchpad Pro User Guide](https://resource.novationmusic.com/support/product-downloads?product=Launchpad+Pro) for details.

2. Open Terminal and run the background MIDI daemon: `sh start.sh`

3. Double click the `Shruti Practice.nkm` practice file to launch/reload Kontakt/Kontakt Player

4. Open MIDI Preferences. Turn off mapping for default Launchpad inputs. Set `midimap` to Port A. ![Setting up midimap routing in Kontakt](docs/kontakt-midimap.gif)

5. Adjust the key root. By default the scale is set to C. (The demo below shows how to adjust it to D i.e. two half steps.)

   1. Set the `Tune` parameter to the number of half steps in the top, playable instrument.
   2. Set the `Root` key in the second background tanpura instrument.
   3. Press the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon to start the background tanpura. ![Setting the scale/key root for the tanpuras](/Users/Krish/Documents/GitHub/launchpad-shruti-practice/docs/kontakt-adjust-root.gif)
   4. To adjust tuning of Concert A (default 440Hz), open the `Master` pane and adjust the `Master Tune` parameter as needed. ![Adjusting the value of A440 Hz globally](docs/kontakt-adjust-a440.gif)

6. Save your settings to a new file by clicking `Load/Save` (floppy disk icon) > `Save Multi as...` ![Saving settings to a new file](docs/kontakt-saving-settings.gif)

## Shruti Colors

### Definition

The ratios of the 22 shrutis used are the same as those defined and researched by Dr. Vidyadhar Oke. The RGB values are sent via Sysex commands and are specified in `lpp-colors.smidi`.

| **Shruti** | **Ratio** | **ET Offset (Cents)** | **Launchpad RGB** | **Color**    |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| S          | 1         | 0.0                   | 25 25 25          | White        |

| M2         | 27/20     | 19.6                  |                   |              |

### Aiding in Interval Recognition

Because of the 8 x 8 grid, there are several prominent intervals that can be spotted visually. Not that horizontal notes wrap across to the next row.

| **Direction** | **Note Color**          | **Interval**                                       | **Ratio** |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| ‚ÜñÔ∏è             | color <-> non-color     | Just major third                                   | 5/4       |
| ‚ÜôÔ∏è             | like <-> like           | Descending perfect fourth (inverted perfect fifth) | 2/3       |
| ‚ÜóÔ∏è             | like <-> like           | Perfect fourth                                     | 4/3       |
| ‚ÜîÔ∏è             | color <-> color         | Poorna shruti (Pythagorean limma)                  | 256/243   |
| ‚ÜîÔ∏è             | color <-> non-color     | Praman shruti (Syntonic comma)                     | 81/80     |
| ‚ÜîÔ∏è             | non-color <-> non-color | Nyuna shruti (diatonic semitone)                   | 25/24     |

The last three are particularly noteworthy in that they are the building blocks for all 22 shrutis. By noting the number of colored and uncolored notes are present between two shrutis, analogies for transpositions (murchanas) can be better understood. 

For example:

* R2 is to P as P is to S: a perfect fourth below.
* D2 is to P as R2 is to S: horizontal interval of two colored notes and two uncolored notes!
* D1 is a perfect fourth above G1 but is also a major third from M1. If both are in the raga, D1 will be particularly stable.
* Given the previous two observations, D2 is related to Pancham whereas D1 is related to Madhyam!

## Build Requirements

This would be if you want to start from scratch and/or support new tunings.

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
  * To install simply run: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
* [Scala by Manuel Op de Coul](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/index.html) (not the language) for generating Kontakt Script files
  * I suppose these can be done by hand as well but ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  * Included `bundle-scala.sh` uses Wine to bundle a runnable App! (Mac instructions on website badly out of date.)
  * Otherwise, could run Scala on Windows/Linux and copy over the files.
* Kontakt 5 or [Kontakt 6](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/samplers/kontakt-6/) in order to access the instrument editor (wrench icon)

  - Tested with Kontakt 5.8.1
* Bash 4 or greater 
  * Can be installed with Homebrew: `brew install bash`
  * Used by the `set-key.sh` script

## Remarks

* I initially attempted the Discovery Series tanpura for the playable tanpura as well. However its playable MIDI range 48-84 is enforced _before_ the Kontakt remapping script takes effect, and this feature does not seem to be able to be turned off even by disabling the articulation script in the Kontakt script editor. In a way, the Kontakt Factory Library tanpura offers a less twangy and suprisingly consistent sound suitable for a playable swar mandal instrument.
* Velocities of notes can be adjusted by the `velocities.txt` template and re-running the `set-key.sh` script.
